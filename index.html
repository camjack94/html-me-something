              <p> <b></b>Bob Marley where should i start he has captured the world with music alone<br> actually one of the artist i would like to see live in concert.<br><b>The first Song</b><br>the first song was three little bird this song honestly felt like it taught me alot through life in a sense throught its lyrics of hard times <br><b>"Don't worry about a thing,
                'Cause every little thing gonna be all right.
                Singin': "don't worry about a thing,
                'Cause every little thing gonna be all right!".</b><br>
                These lyrics made me feel like that in tough situations in my life that i dont need to worry things will workout in the best way possible for me and my life.<br> So bob will always be my number one artist and im blessed to figure such a artist out.</b>

                  <b>YE:</b>Mr.west man musically i never seen so much talent and hard work in one man and alot of hits with this man he is by far a creative genius in my mind the sounds and albums sometimes he goes beyond what the music is now perfect example "Yeezus" that album alone was way ahead of its time and now i hear alot more people going back to it.<br>Things like that makes him great when is comes down to this music.<br><b>His Inspiration</b><br> I remeber the first time i listen to Kanye it my mom was bumping him in the car the album was college dropout and DAWG! i just remeber becoming a fan instantly like yo nobody can touch this right now and he just continued.<br>Now keep in mind that i was a kid but getting older and understanding what he went through was tough didnt know he delt with so much such as in people telling him couldnt rap and getting his jaw wired shut from a car wreck ye had given me that inspiration from striving to prove people wrong.<br>He created and keep going he shut the world down with "Jesus walks" something new and unheard of to play on mainstream radio the label that he was currenty with did not want that to be his first main stream but ye once again proved them wrong.<br>This is what kept me in loops of always remeber to be yourself no matter what you do cause cant nobody be like you only you and seeing things like this will always and foreve stick with me.<br>My favorite album so far from is "My beautiful dark twisted fantasy" that album to was the most creative have a listen if you haven't.

                  <b>THE HERO:</b> Childish Gambino the hero that got me through highschool outside of cudi. Gambino had said this line in his mixtape called "Culdisac" in a song called THE LAST <b>"But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
                    Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
                    Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it".</b><br>This lyric taught me more how to be myself in alot of ways just that be honest and alot of good things can come from it of course you have to be careful in ways but man the enjoyment of that when i first heard it stuck with me till this day. He also released a album called because the interenet and that album opened my eyes in a perspective the song that got to me the most is <b>"III. Life: The Biggest Troll [Andrew Auernheimer]"</b> I think that you should have a listen. <br><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4lLR5MdqQx2d2jS0VEScUW" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe><br> Overall music to me touches the soul fixes mood music is a way of life sometimes it just carries you away from everything. But here is some more of Childish gambinos music.<br><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/73sIBHcqh3Z3NyqHKZ7FOL" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
